# Day 1 - Deep Learning Fundamentals

- Provides a solid foundation for understanding the basic concepts and components of deep learning.
- The speaker notes offer additional context and explanations to help the instructor effectively convey the material to the audience.

## Slide 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

- What is Deep Learning?
  - Definition: Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.
  

### Speaker Notes:
 Deep Learning has revolutionized various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, by enabling machines to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions from large amounts of data.

## Slide 2: History and Evolution of Deep Learning
- Key milestones:
  - 1943: McCulloch & Pitts - first mathematical model of a neural network
  - 1958: Rosenblatt - Perceptron, the first neural network capable of learning
  - 1980s: Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams - Backpropagation algorithm
  - 2012: Krizhevsky, Sutskever & Hinton - AlexNet, deep CNN for image classification
  

### Speaker Notes:
 The field of deep learning has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with major breakthroughs in architectures, training techniques, and computational resources that have enabled the development of powerful AI systems.

## Slide 3: Applications of Deep Learning
- Examples across various industries:
  - Healthcare: Medical image analysis, drug discovery, patient risk prediction
  - Automotive: Autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems
  - Finance: Fraud detection, risk assessment, stock market prediction
  

### Speaker Notes:
 Deep Learning has found applications in numerous industries, solving complex problems and automating tasks that were previously challenging or impossible for machines to perform.

## Slide 4: Anatomy of a Neural Network
- Neurons, weights, biases, and layers:
  - Neurons: Basic building blocks of neural networks, inspired by biological neurons
  - Weights: Learnable parameters that determine the strength of connections between neurons
  - Biases: Additional learnable parameters that allow neurons to shift their output
  - Layers: Organized groups of neurons that process and transform input data
  

### Speaker Notes:
 Understanding the structure and components of neural networks is essential for designing and training deep learning models effectively.

## Slide 5: Activation Functions
- Sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, and their roles:
  - Sigmoid: Squashes input values to the range [0, 1], historically popular but less common now
  - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): Most widely used activation function, introduces non-linearity and sparsity
  - tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): Squashes input values to the range [-1, 1], often used in recurrent neural networks
  

### Speaker Notes:
 Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns and make non-linear transformations of the input data.

## Slide 6: Loss Functions and Optimizers
- Loss functions: Quantify the difference between predicted and actual outputs
  - Examples: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross-Entropy Loss
- Optimizers: Algorithms that update the learnable parameters of a neural network to minimize the loss function
  - Examples: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop


### Speaker Notes:
 Loss functions and optimizers work together to guide the learning process of neural networks, allowing them to improve their performance iteratively by adjusting the learnable parameters based on the feedback from the loss function.

## Slide 7: Backpropagation
- Concept: Algorithm used to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the learnable parameters of a neural network
- Chain rule: Fundamental principle behind backpropagation, allows the gradients to be calculated efficiently by recursively applying the chain rule of calculus


### Speaker Notes:
 Backpropagation is the cornerstone of training deep neural networks, enabling the efficient calculation of gradients and the updating of learnable parameters to minimize the loss function.
